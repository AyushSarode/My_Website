<h2>what is a Microcontroler?</h2>
<p>A microcontroller (or MCU for microcontroller unit) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit. In modern terminology, it is similar to,<br />
but less sophisticated than, a system on a chip or SoC; an SoC may include a microcontroller as one of its components. A microcontroller contains one or more<br />
 CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals. Program memory in the form of ferroelectric RAM, NOR flash or OTP<br /> 
 ROM is also often included on chip, as well as a small amount of RAM. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the<br />
 microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications consisting of various discrete chips.<br />
<br />
Microcontrollers are used in automatically controlled products and devices, such as automobile engine control systems, implatable medical devices,<br /> 
remote controls, office machines, appliances, power tools, toys and other embedded systems. By reducing the size and cost compared to a design that uses<br /> 
a separate microprocessor, memory, and input/output devices, microcontrollers make it economical to digitally control even more devices and processes.<br />
 Mixed signal microcontrollers are common, integrating analog components needed to control non-digital electronic systems.</p>
<h2>other Microcontroler features: </h2>
<p>Microcontrollers usually contain from several to dozens of general purpose input/output pins (GPIO). GPIO pins are software configurable to either<br />
an input or an output state. When GPIO pins are configured to an input state, they are often used to read sensors or external signals.<br />
 Configured to the output state, GPIO pins can drive external devices such as LEDs or motors, often indirectly, through external power electronics.<br />
<br />
Many embedded systems need to read sensors that produce analog signals. This is the purpose of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC).<br />
 Since processors are built to interpret and process digital data, i.e. 1s and 0s, they are not able to do anything with the analog signals <br />
 that may be sent to it by a device. So the analog to digital converter is used to convert the incoming data into a form that the processor can recognize.<br />
 A less common feature on some microcontrollers is a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that allows the processor to output analog signals or voltage levels.<br />
<br />
In addition to the converters, many embedded microprocessors include a variety of timers as well. One of the most common types of timers is the <br />
programmable interval timer (PIT). A PIT may either count down from some value to zero, or up to the capacity of the count register, overflowing to zero.<br />
 Once it reaches zero, it sends an interrupt to the processor indicating that it has finished counting. This is useful for devices such as thermostats,<br />
 which periodically test the temperature around them to see if they need to turn the air conditioner on, the heater on, etc.<br />
<br />
A dedicated pulse-width modulation (PWM) block makes it possible for the CPU to control power converters, resistive loads, motors, etc., without using <br />
lots of CPU resources in tight timer loops.
<br />
A universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) block makes it possible to receive and transmit data over a serial line with very little load on the CPU.<br />
 Dedicated on-chip hardware also often includes capabilities to communicate with other devices (chips) in digital formats such as <br />
 Inter-Integrated Circuit (IÂ²C), Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Universal Serial Bus (USB), and Ethernet.[14]</p>

<h2>About Arduino</h2>
<p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor,<br />
 a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. <br />
 You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language <br />
 (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.<br />

Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments.<br />
 A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform,<br />
 their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.<br />

Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics <br />
and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its <br />
offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely<br />
 open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. The software, too, is open-source, <br />
 and it is growing through the contributions of users worldwide. </p>
