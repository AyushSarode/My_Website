<h5> Some more attacks are Man In The Middle(MITM) , Msfvenom , etc
</h5>
<h1> Man In The Middle(MITM):</h1>
<p>In cryptography and computer security, a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM; also Janus attack) is an attack where the attacker secretly<br />
 relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. <br />
One example of man-in-the-middle attacks is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims<br />
 and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the <br />
entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims<br />
 and inject new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within reception range of an unencrypted wireless<br />
 access point (Wi-Fi) could insert himself as a man-in-the-middle.
As an attack that aims at circumventing<br />
 mutual authentication, or lack thereof, a man-in-the-middle attack can succeed only when the attacker can impersonate each endpoint to their satisfaction<br />
 as expected from the legitimate ends. Most cryptographic protocols include some form of endpoint authentication specifically to prevent MITM attacks.<br />
 For example, TLS can authenticate one or both parties using a mutually trusted certificate authority.

<h1> Msfvenom</h1>
<p>The Metasploit Framework has included the useful tools msfpayload and msfencode for quite sometime. These tools are extremely useful<br />
for generating payloads in various formats and encoding these payloads using various encoder modules. Now I would like to introduce a new tool<br />
 which I have been working on for the past week, msfvenom. This tool combines all the functionality of msfpayload and msfencode in a single tool.<br />
Merging these two tools into a single tool just made sense. It standardizes the command line options, speeds things up a bit by using a single framework<br />
instance, handles all possible output formats, and brings some sanity to payload generation.

<h1>what is Kali Linux:</h1>
<p>

Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing. Kali contains several hundred tools which are geared<br />
 towards various information security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security research, Computer Forensics and Reverse Engineering. Kali Linux is developed,<br />
 funded and maintained by Offensive Security, a leading information security training company.<br />
Kali Linux was released on the 13th March, 2013 as a complete, top-to-bottom rebuild of BackTrack Linux, adhering completely to Debian development standards.<br />
<UL>

   <li> More than 600 penetration testing tools included: After reviewing every tool that was included in BackTrack, we eliminated a great number<br />
of tools that either simply did not work or which duplicated other tools that provided the same or similar functionality. <br />
Details on what’s included are on the Kali Tools site.</li>

    <li>Free (as in beer) and always will be: Kali Linux, like BackTrack, is completely free of charge and always will be. <br />
You will never, ever have to pay for Kali Linux.</li>
    
<li>Open source Git tree: We are committed to the open source development model and our development tree is available for all to see.<br />
 All of the source code which goes into Kali Linux is available for anyone who wants to tweak or rebuild packages to suit their specific needs.</li>
    
<li>FHS compliant: Kali adheres to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, allowing Linux users to easily locate binaries, support files, libraries, etc.</li>
    
<li>Wide-ranging wireless device support: A regular sticking point with Linux distributions has been supported for wireless interfaces.<br />
 We have built Kali Linux to support as many wireless devices as we possibly can, allowing it to run properly on a wide variety of hardware<br />
 and making it compatible with numerous USB and other wireless devices.</li>
  
  <li>Custom kernel, patched for injection: As penetration testers, the development team often needs to do wireless assessments,<br />
 so our kernel has the latest injection patches included.</li>

   <li> Developed in a secure environment: The Kali Linux team is made up of a small group of individuals who are the only ones trusted <br />
to commit packages and interact with the repositories, all of which is done using multiple secure protocols.</li>

<li>   GPG signed packages and repositories: Every package in Kali Linux is signed by each individual developer who built and committed it,<br />
 and the repositories subsequently sign the packages as well.</li>

   <li> Multi-language support: Although penetration tools tend to be written in English, we have ensured that Kali includes true<br />
 multilingual support, allowing more users to operate in their native language and locate the tools they need for the job.</li>

<li>    Completely customizable: We thoroughly understand that not everyone will agree with our design decisions, so we have made <br />
it as easy as possible for our more adventurous users to customize Kali Linux to their liking, all the way down to the kernel.</li>

    <li>ARMEL and ARMHF support: Since ARM-based single-board systems like the Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone Black, among others, are becoming<br />
 more and more prevalent and inexpensive, we knew that Kali’s ARM support would need to be as robust as we could manage,<br />
 with fully working installations for both ARMEL and ARMHF systems. Kali Linux is available on a wide range of ARM devices and has ARM repositories<br />
 integrated with the mainline distribution so tools for ARM are updated in conjunction with the rest of the distribution.</li>
</UL>
Kali Linux is specifically tailored to the needs of penetration testing professionals, and therefore all documentation on this site assumes prior knowledge of,<br />
and familiarity with, the Linux operating system in general. Please see Should I Use Kali Linux? for more details on what makes Kali unique.
